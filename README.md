### Node.js and Express:
These technologies were used to build the backend of the application. They are both fast, scalable, and easy to use, making them ideal for building robust server-side applications.

### React:
React was used to build the frontend of the application. It is a popular JavaScript library that provides a fast and efficient way to build user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable UI components, which is important for building large-scale applications.

### TypeScript:
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that provides additional safety and correctness guarantees. By using TypeScript, we can catch errors before they happen and make our code more maintainable.

### Material UI:
Material UI is a popular React UI library that provides a set of reusable UI components that are easy to customize and use. By using Material UI, we can build a consistent and visually appealing UI.

### Axios:
Axios is a popular JavaScript library that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests. It is widely used and has good support, making it a reliable choice for communicating with the backend.

### React Router:
React Router is a popular routing library for React that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for handling navigation in a single-page application. By using React Router, we can build a scalable and maintainable navigation system.
